                  final and binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal
                  Arbitration Act, conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and
                  administered by the American Arbitration Association, or a
                  similar arbitration service selected by the parties, in a

                  shall be determined by the Arbitrator. This arbitration

                <p>
                  Humanified reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
                  terminate your access to the Site and the related services or
                  any portion thereof at any time, without notice. To the
                  maximum extent permitted by law, this agreement is governed by
                  the laws of the State of New York and you hereby consent to
                  the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in New York in
                  all disputes arising out of or relating to the use of the
                  Site. Use of the Site is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that
                  does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms,
                  including, without limitation, this section.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or
                  agency relationship exists between you and Humanified as a
                  result of this agreement or use of the Site. Humanified's
                  performance of this agreement is subject to existing laws and
                  legal process, and nothing contained in this agreement is in
                  derogation of Humanified's right to comply with governmental,
                  court and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to
                  your use of the Site or information provided to or gathered by
                  Humanified with respect to such use. If any part of this
                  agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable
                  pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the
                  warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth
                  above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be
                  deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most
                  closely matches the intent of the original provision and the
                  remainder of the agreement shall continue in effect.{" "}

                  Unless otherwise specified herein, this agreement constitutes
                  the entire agreement between the user and Humanified with
                  respect to the Site and it supersedes all prior or
                  contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether
                  electronic, oral or written, between the user and Humanified
                  with respect to the Site. A printed version of this agreement
                  and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible
                  in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or
                  relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to
                  the same conditions as other business documents and records
                  originally generated and maintained in printed form. It is the
                  express wish to the parties that this agreement and all
                  related documents be written in English.{" "}
